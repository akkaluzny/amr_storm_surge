== Notes/Ideas

.Possible criteria to consider:
* basic thresholds on components of the solution and storm
* distances (from the storm eye, or perhaps some other feauture)
* energy in a cell
* gradients or simply differences across cells
* intersections of other criteria (e.g. distance d from the eye and wind speed > w, etc)
* linear or non-linear combinations of other criteria
** would need some idea of how to limit this space


.Choosing criteria thresholds:
* for a single criteria, could do something like a binary search until the performance is optimized while keeping the soln good enough
* choose thresholds that seem to flag cells similarly to some reference
** need a way to get a good reference (i.e. a strong idea of which cells should/need to be refined)


.Measures of solution quality:
* Compare to a reference solution at gauges (either from geoclaw or some other simulation)
** What about refinement at those gauges? Could force refinement, otherwise might favor criteria that refine at the gauges


.Measures of performance:
* Number of cells (advantage: independent of computing power)
* cpu time (advantage: incorporates the performance of the criteria themselves)
